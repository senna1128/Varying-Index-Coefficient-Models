Pop_Int_SNPdata.csv = prefiltered SNP array identified in the Intermediate population of Coffea canephora, with dimensions of 119 x 45748 (ind x marker). Chromosome and position of each SNP are represented in the matrix column name. For example, the SNP named 10.2664 was mapped into the genome on chromosome 10 and position 2664.

Pop_Prec_SNPdata.csv = prefiltered SNP array identified in the Premature population of Coffea canephora, with dimensions of 96 x 59332 (ind x marker). Chromosome and position of each SNP are represented in the matrix column name. For example, the SNP named 10.2664 was mapped into the genome on chromosome 10 and position 2664. 

Pop_Int_PHENOdata.csv = phenotypic data set. Two first columns are representing the population (Intermediate) and environments (FEM and FES) where the traits were evaluated. Other columns are the adjusted phenotypic values for three coffee traits: production of coffee beans, rust incidence, and yield of green coffee beans. 

Pop_Prec_PHENOdata.csv = phenotypic data set. Two first columns are representing the population (Premature) and environments (FEM and FES) where the traits were evaluated. Other columns are the adjusted phenotypic values for three coffee traits: production of coffee beans, rust incidence, and yield of green coffee beans.
